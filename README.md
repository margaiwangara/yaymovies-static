## Yay Movies v1.1.0

In this update, the entire user interface for yaymovies has been changed. The project has three main components, the header which holds the navbar and the movies-in-theatre details, the center main-content contains tabs to move between different movie categories, in-theatres, trending, popular and coming-soon, the bottom component has the footer which displays a link for the site, social-media-links and copyright

The project has heavily utilised CSS Flex and Grid layouts. Some animation has also been used in the center component.

The site is fully responsive across all devices

# In This Project

I learned simple design skills, color co-relation, typography and took the opportunity to improve my skills in CSS. I used flexbox and CSS grid layouts to align most of the components in place.
